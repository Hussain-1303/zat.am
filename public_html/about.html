        <h3>Organization</h3>Samskrita Bharati, a non-profit organization, is primarily dedicated to the mission of popularizing Sanskrit as a spoken language. Moving beyond veneration of Sanskrit as a classical or exotic language, Samskrita Bharati seeks
        to make this a contemporary language whose everyday usage becomes customary and widespread.
        <h3>Movement</h3>This goal is being gradually realized with steady progress in the escalating numbers of Sanskrit speakers globally, increase in Sanskrit speaking families worldwide, and even a rise in Sanskrit spoken villages in India. Such preliminary
        success has served as a powerful catalyst to effect further change, and initiate a potent cultural renaissance movement.
        <h3>Language</h3>As a language, संस्कृतम् (a.k.a. Sanskrit) is the cultural backbone of India. It holds the key to India's timeless, rich, cultural heritage. Knowledge of Sanskrit opens new vistas in areas such as Indian philosophy, yoga, ayurveda,
        mathematics, etc. By restoring Sanskrit to its rightful place in the cultural legacy of India, it is believed that the fate of India's cultural heritage will also be secured. Besides being a treasure trove of knowledge, Sanskrit has the power
        to unify India. The language of Sanskrit holds no boundaries. The appeal is widespread across people from all walks of life, different generations, religious backgrounds, and regional affiliations.
