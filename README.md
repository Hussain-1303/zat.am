After groundbreaking "TA-RG-ET संस्कृतम्" hackathon (https://www.iitr.ac.in/sanskritclub/target.html) initiated on गीताजयन्ती २०२० #codeSanskrit gains momentum.

We aspire to collect/create at least 100 "Teaching Aids" or "Recreational Games" or "Edutainment Tools" for Sanskrit here!

जयतु संस्कृतम्।

PS: more details/updates will be added as we proceed further - a movement is impossible without movers and shakers to come together - all are welcome!
