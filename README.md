 - Add (with due credits/info) even if it is “Proof of Concept”

Inspiration/End Goal:
 - Sugarlabs for Samskritam -  https://www.sugarlabs.org/
 
- Supported by volunteers of Sanskrita Bharati

  Samskrita Bharati, a non-profit organization, is primarily dedicated to the mission of popularizing Sanskrit as a spoken language. Moving beyond veneration of    Sanskrit as a classical or exotic language, Samskrita Bharati seeks to make this a contemporary language whose everyday usage becomes customary and widespread. Samskrita Bharati is a 501-(c)-(3) non-profit organization.

We aspire to collect/create 100+ "Teaching Aids" or "Recreational Games" or "Edutainment Tools" for Sanskrit here!

जयतु संस्कृतम्।

PS: more details/updates will be added as we proceed further - a movement is impossible without movers and shakers to come together - all are welcome!
